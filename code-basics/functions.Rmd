This is a very short introduction to functions.

We will soon go into more detail on functions, in the page on [call expressions](Calls).

For now, we start with something simple, the function `cos`.


Remember functions from mathematics?  We might write something like this, in mathematics:

$$
y = cos(0)
$$

You can read $cos(0)$ as:

> Call the function "cos" with the value 0, and return the result.

Then $y = cos(0)$ means:

> Call the function "cos" with the value 0, and return the result, storing the result in "y".

We *pass* a value to the function.  In our case we pass the value $0$.

The function *returns* a value.  In our case it returns the calculation of the cosine of $0$.

You may remember that the cosine of 0 is 1.  So, after $y = cos(0)$, we expect $y$ to equal 1.


Functions in Python work in a similar way.


First we load up the `cos` function from a library called `numpy`.

Don't worry about the command to load the function, for now.  We will come back
to that later.  Here is the command you need. Just run it in the notebook.

```{python}
# Get the cos function from the numpy library.
from numpy import cos
```

Now we *call* the `cos` function with the value 0, and see what we get:

```{python}
cos(0)
```

* `cos` is the *name* of the function;
* `0` is the *value* we as *passing* to the function.
* The value we pass to the function goes between the parentheses `(` and `)`.
* `1.0` is the value that the function *returns*.

The value we pass to the function is also called the function *argument*.

In our case we pass `0` as the *argument* to the `cos` function.


Let's try the same thing with the `sin` function:

```{python}
# Get the sin function from the numpy library.
from numpy import sin
```

```{python}
sin(0)
```

* `sin` - the function name;
* `0` - the value we pass to the function;
* The value goes after the function name, and between parentheses;
* `0.0` - the value that the function returns.

We pass `0` as the *argument* to the `sin` function.


Now your turn.

Try importing the `sqrt` function.

```{python}
# Get the sqrt function from the numpy library.
# Your code here.
```

Call the `sqrt` function with the value `9`; you should see this returns the value `3.0`.

```{python}
# Your code here.
```

We will see more about functions in the section on [call expressions](Calls).
