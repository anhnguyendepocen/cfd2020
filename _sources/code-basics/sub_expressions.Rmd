The [expressions](Expressions) page introduced the idea of expressions as:

> a recipe that returns a value.

When Python *evaluates* an expression, it follows the recipe to return the
value.

In this page we go into a little more detail on expressions, and we consider sub-expressions.

We do this to get used to the more general idea in programming, of building
complex things from simple building blocks, according to simple rules.

A large part of learning how to program is understanding what the computer is doing as a result of the code you type.  You can do this by breaking down code into simpler building blocks, and understanding how the parts are combined.

Consider this expression:

```{python}
(10.50 + 9.25) * 0.15
```

Here is the full process that Python goes through, when evaluating `(10.50 + 9.25) * 0.15`. Python will:

* evaluate the expression `10.50` to give the computer representation (CR) of 10.50;
* evaluate the expression `9.25` to give the CR of 10.50;
* evaluate the expression 10.50 `+` 9.25 to give the CR of 19.75;
* evaluate the expression 19.75 `*` 0.15 to give the CR of 2.9625.

## Sub-expressions

A *compound* expression is an expression made up of smaller *sub-expressions*.

A *sub-expression* is a smaller part of the compound expression, that Python will evaluate as part of evaluating the compound expression.

For example: here is a compound expression, made up of two sub-expressions:

```{python}
10.50 + 9.25
```

The two sub-expressions are:

* `10.50`: an expression that returns the CR of the number 10.50;
* `9.25`: an expression that returns the CR of the number 9.25.

When Python evaluates `10.50 + 9.25`, it first evaluates these two sub-expressions, then evaluates the final result by adding the results of these two sub-expressions.

Reconsider:

```{python}
(10.50 + 9.25) * 0.15
```

There are four sub-expressions here:

* `10.50` as above;
* `9.25` as above;
* `0.15` returns the CR of the number 0.15;
* `(10.50 + 9.25)` is a compound expression that is itself a sub-expression of
  the full expression above.  It returns the CR of the
  number 19.75.

Each of these sub-expressions will be evaluated in the process of evaluating `(10.50 + 9.25) * 0.15`.

Now consider:

```{python}
10.50 + 9.25 * 0.15
```

Be careful - remember the rules of [operator precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations).

Let's think again what Python will do here.  It will:

* evaluate the expression `10.50` to gives the CR of 10.50;
* evaluate the expression `9.25` to gives the CR of 10.50;
* (because of the precedence rules) evaluate  9.25 `*` 1.15 to give the
  CR of 1.3875;
* evaluate 10.50 `*` 1.3875 to give the CR of 11.8875.

So, these are the sub-expressions:

* `10.50`;
* `9.25`;
* `0.15`;
* `9.25 * 0.15`.

Note that `10.50 + 9.25` is *not* a sub-expression, because this does not return a value, in the process of evaluating the whole expression.  The value that `9.25` is involved in is 9.25 * 1.3875, where 1.3875 is the value that comes back from `9.25 * 0.15` above.

Let's say I have imported my `cos` function (see the [functions](functions) page):

```{python}
# Get the cos function from the numpy library.
from numpy import cos
```

Now consider:

```{python}
cos(0)
```

`cos(0)` is an expression, because it is a recipe that returns a value.   In fact, it is a [call expression](Calls).

There is one sub-expression to this expression, which is:

* `0` returns the CR of 0;

```{python}
cos(0) + 2
```

has three sub-expressions:

* `0` returns the CR of 0;
* `cos( )` with argument 0, from above, returns the CR of the number 1;
* `2` returns the CR of 2.


Finally, let's say I have defined this variable:

```{python}
a = 10.50
```

Here is an expression:

```{python}
a
```

It is an expression because it is a recipe that returns a value - in this
case, the CR of the number 10.50.
